# py_resize
Resize polygon object uniformly in cinema 4D.  Python Based Plugin.

Note this is the older code from Valkaari that was written in Python.  I did the minor syntax changes for Python 3 required to run it in Cinema 4D R23.  I resurected this plugin because Valkaaries newer version of this plugin was written in C++ and was not updated for R23. Though it is also open source, I was not able to get it working due to my inexperience with C++ Plugins. That version has better features than py_resize. Hopefully Valkaari or sombody else will be able to fix that code up in the future.
