# py_resize
Python Based Plugin For cinema4D R12/R13
Resize selected polygon object uniformly.

Note this is the older code from Valkaari.com that was written in Python.  I did the Python 3 syntax changes required to run it in Cinema 4D R23.  I resurected this plugin because Valkaari's newer version of this plugin was written in C++ and was not updated for R23. Though it is also open source, I was not able to get it working due to my inexperience with C++ Plugins. That version has better features than py_resize. Hopefully Valkaari or sombody else will be able to fix that code up in the future.
